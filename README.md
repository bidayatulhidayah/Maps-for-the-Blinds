# Maps-for-the-Blinds

## Introduction

"Globed for the Blind" is an innovative project aimed at empowering blind individuals by providing them with a unique means to understand and explore the location of the state in Malaysia. Understanding the size of the Earth and its geographical divisions can be difficult for people who are visually impaired. By utilizing technology and design concepts to produce an inclusive and accessible solution, this initiative aims to close that gap.
The objective of "Globed for the Blind" is to create a user-friendly and educational system that enables blind people to comprehend continents spatially. This project seeks to give a multimodal experience that enables blind people to explore, navigate, and visualize the layout of the state in Malaysia by combining tactile and interactive features.

This project has two modes which are mode A includes a Braille keypad with a push button, a xy-gantry for map movement, and automatic audio feedback. The Braille keypad allows easy navigation, while the xy-gantry lifts and moves the map for tactile exploration. The system provides informative audio feedback about the map's content. This technology enhances accessibility, independence, and understanding of maps for visually impaired individuals, promoting inclusivity and empowering them to navigate their surroundings with greater confidence.

The second mode is the assistive technology system, each state is equipped with a touch sensor. When a user touches the touch sensor, it triggers the system to turn on the audio feature. This modification ensures that the audio is activated and ready to provide information as soon as the user engages with the touch sensor. This added functionality enhances the user experience by streamlining the process of accessing audio instructions and information, allowing visually impaired individuals to quickly and easily engage with the system.
